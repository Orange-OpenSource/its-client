This repository provides reference implementation of message exchanging for IoT3 over [MQTT][1] (v5).\
On top of this, it also provides a proposal of implementation for V2X messages in [JSON][2] based on [ETSI][3]'s
Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS).

For both of these use cases, telemetry is both automatically done and abstracted to send custom traces.

Features
--------

|                       | Rust | Python | Java |
|-----------------------|:----:|:------:|:----:|
| **MQTTv5**            |  ✓   |   ✓    |  ✓   |
| **Telemetry**         |  ✓   |   ✓    |  ✓   |

### Message exchange

Each implementation provides a client implementation allowing to subscribe and publish to an MQTT broker.

### Telemetry

Each implementation might provide an abstraction of Open Telemetry features.

| Language | Traces | Logs | Metrics |
|----------|--------|------|---------|
| Rust     | ✓      |      |         |
| Python   | ✓      |      |         |
| Java     | ✓      |      |         |

#### Traces

Depending on client's choice or implementation, MQTT message publishing and reception might be automatically traced.\
The link between the span of a message publish and the span of its reception is automatically made
by propagating the [W3C Trace Context][12] using MQTTv5 properties.

Sent traces include the following parameters:

- `service_name` client app name (configurable)
- `span.status` Error if anything went wrong, Unset otherwise
- `span.name` IoT3 Core MQTT Message
- `span.kind`
  - `consumer` when receiving a message
  - `producer` when publishing a message
- attributes:
    - `iot3.core.mqtt.topic`
    - `iot3.core.mqtt.payload_size`
    - `iot3.core.sdk_language`

JSON schemas
------------

As mentioned, you can find in the `schemas` directory a proposal of implementation using the [JSON][2] language
(instead of ASN.1 UPER by default) of the following [ETSI.org][3] messages:
- CooperativeAwarenessMessage (CAM)
- CollectivePerceptionMessage (CPM)
- DecentralizedEmergencyNotificationMessage (DENM)

But also schemas of custom messages for V2X:
- Information (information about service instance)
- Status (status of an instance)

_Note: none of the provided implementation is able to use different versions of a schema,
they are using the following versions:_
  - _[cam_schema_1-1-3](schema/cam_schema_1-1-3.json)_
  - _[cpm_schema_1-2-1](schema/cpm_schema_1-2-1.json)_
  - _[denm_schema_1-1-3](schema/denm_schema_1-1-3.json)_
  - _[information_schema_1-2-0](schema/information_schema_1-2-0.json)_
  - _[status_schema_1-2-0](schema/status_schema_1-2-0.json)_

Languages
---------

The features presented above are hereby provided in several languages in an SDK-like form.

Choice has been made to respect each language paradigm over providing a unique implementation;
it might therefore differ depending on the language.
