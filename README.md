[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

This repository provides reference implementation of message exchanging for IoT3 over [MQTT][1] (v5).\
On top of this, it also provides a proposal of implementation for V2X messages in [JSON][2] based on [ETSI][3]'s
Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS).

For both of these use cases, telemetry is both automatically done and abstracted to send custom traces.

Features
--------
The following table provides the current status of features implementation in each language.

|        Feature        | Rust | Python | Java | Swift |
|:---------------------:|:----:|:------:|:----:|:-----:|
|      **MQTTv5**       |  ✓   |   ✓    |  ✓   |   ✓   |
|     **Telemetry**     |  ✓   |   ✓    |  ✓   |   ✓   |
| **Device Management** |      |        |      |       |

### Message exchange

Each implementation provides a client implementation allowing to subscribe and publish to an MQTT broker.

### Telemetry

Each implementation might provide an abstraction of Open Telemetry (https://opentelemetry.io/) Signals concepts.
The following table provides the current implementation status of telemetry in each language.

|   Signal    | Rust | Python | Java | Swift |
|:-----------:|:----:|:------:|:----:|:-----:|
| **Traces**  |  ✓   |   ✓    |  ✓   |   ✓   |
|  **Logs**   |      |        |      |       |
| **Metrics** |      |        |      |       |
| **Baggage** |      |        |      |       |

#### Traces

Depending on client's choice or implementation, MQTT message publishing and reception might be automatically traced.\
The link between the span of a message publish and the span of its reception is automatically made
by propagating the [W3C Trace Context][12] using MQTTv5 properties.

Sent traces include the following parameters:

- `service.name` client app name (configurable)
- `span.status` Error if anything went wrong, Unset otherwise
- `span.name` IoT3 Core MQTT Message
- `span.kind`
    - `consumer` when receiving a message
    - `producer` when publishing a message
- attributes:
    - `iot3.core.mqtt.topic`
    - `iot3.core.mqtt.payload_size`
    - `iot3.core.sdk_language`

### Device management

_**Work in progress**_

Each implementation is _intended_ to provide an implementation of LwM2M protocol to bootstrap the device or application,
and to send periodical alive messages.
The following table provides the current implementation status of LwM2M protocol in each language.

| Device Management | Rust | Python | Java | Swift |
|:-----------------:|:----:|:------:|:----:|:-----:|
|   **Bootstrap**   |      |        |      |       |
|      **Run**      |      |        |      |       |

JSON schemas
------------

As mentioned, you can find in the `schemas` directory a proposal of implementation using the [JSON][2] language
(instead of ASN.1 UPER by default) of the following [ETSI.org][3] messages:

- CooperativeAwarenessMessage (CAM)
- CollectivePerceptionMessage (CPM)
- DecentralizedEmergencyNotificationMessage (DENM)
- MAPExtendedMessage (MAPEM)
- SignalPhaseAndTimingExtendedMessage (SPATEM)
- SignalRequestExtendedMessage (SREM)
- SignalStatusExtendedMessage (SSEM)

But also schemas of custom messages for V2X:

- Bootstrap (startup of the device)
- Information (information about service instance)
- Status (status of an instance)
- Neighbourhood (instances "around")
- Region (geographic area)

_Note: none of the provided implementation is able to use different versions of a schema,
they are using the following versions:
