Go to the `Preview`, right above,
and select the appropriate template in the list:

* [Python](?expand=1&template=python.md)
* [Rust](?expand=1&template=rust.md)
* [Swift](?expand=1&template=swift.md)

If no template matches your changes, remove this whole text,
and enter your own description with the following information:

* In the title text:
    * the main impacted component
    * a short summary of the changes
* In the description:
    * a human-readable summary of the changes, with a focus on semantics
      rather than technical details (unless that's really important)
    * a list of issues this PR closes
    * the sequence of steps to test the changes
    * the expected result for each steps in 3, above
